# Keyboard 
This is the firmware that I adapted from @huytd for their snackymini  
keyboard. That's about it.  

## Details  
Firmware is for a Dell-AT101 keyboard. It is a ANSI 104 keyboard.  

## Design Choices  
I chose to use a teensy 3.2 because no other controller that I was looking  
had enough digital I/O slots to support the number that I needed with  
the ANSI 104 form factor.  

## Why  

I do not think any of this stuff is particularly important but it is quite  
fun to document the process. * say this in a a British accent. *  

## Progress  

**3/28** I have finished wiring the ROW and COL of the keyboard. Waiting  
for more hookup wire to wire them to the teensy.
