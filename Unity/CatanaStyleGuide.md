## Class Declaration

### Member Declaration 

Group similar declarations together, placing public parts earlier.  


A class definition should usually start with a public section and then private.  


Within each section, generally prefer grouping similar kinds of declarations  
together, and generally prefer to sorted by: alphabetized type and similarity.  

### Function Declaration

Always declare protection level.
