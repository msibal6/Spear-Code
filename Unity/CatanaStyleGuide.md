## Class Declaration

### Member Declaration 

Group similar declarations together, placing public parts earlier.  


A class definition should usually start with a public section and then private.  


Within each section, generally prefer grouping similar kinds of declarations  
together, and generally prefer to sorted by: alphabetized type and similarity.  

### Function Declaration

Always declare protection level. 


## Comments

Before you comment, use concise and reasonable  names for new classes,  
variables, and functions.

### Comments Style   
Use the `//` style. 

When commenting before a line of code, comment right on top of the line of  
cod, and leave an empty line between the comment and the previous line of code. 
When commenting inline, comment a space after the code.  

### Class Comments
use the `///` summary syntax. Begin and end the block of comments with  
the `/// summary` comment line.
