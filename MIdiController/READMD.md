# MIDI Controller
This was a birthday gift that I made 

## Design process
I wanted to make a simple MIDI controller that would be a good starter MIDI control device. 

## Code
The code that works and is currently running on the controller is the one in the DJTT_DIY_MIDI folder. It is just an extension of their code with eight digital buttons instead of four.
